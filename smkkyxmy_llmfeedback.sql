Let\\\'s keep it simple and start with the first service that appears open: FTP (short for File Transfer Protocol), which provides a simple mechanism to share files across a network. In particular, it looks like our target is running vsftpd 2.3.4 (2.3.4 refers to the version). Using available resources - to include CVE Details, Rapid7\\\'s exploit database, cve.org, NIST\\\'s National Vulnerability Database (NVD), The Exploit Database, and any available web resources - look for a vulnerability associated with this version of the FTP service. Provide a short, high-level explanation of any vulnerabilities found for this service, including any Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) numbers associated with this vulnerability.', 35, 0, 'It\\\'s the first result on Google for \\\"vsftpd 2.3.4 CVE\\\".', NULL),
